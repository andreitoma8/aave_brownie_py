This is a Smart Contract demo made in Brownie to interact with the basic functions of the Aave DeFi protocol.  

What it does:
1. Swap ETH to WETH
2. Deposit ETH into Aave
3. Borrow DAI with ETH collateral
4. Repay the debt

This was made with following the freeCodeCamp Solidity with Python course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ
